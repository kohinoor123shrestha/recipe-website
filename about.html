          <h1><b><u>ABOUT ME </h1></b></u> 
          <p> Hi! I'm Kohinoor Shrestha, a passionate home cook and food enthusiast dedicated to sharing delicious recipes and culinary inspiration.
           With a lifelong love for cooking and an insatiable curiosity for flavors from around the world, I created this website as a way to
            connect with fellow food lovers and provide them with mouthwatering recipes they can enjoy in the comfort of their own kitchens.
           <br><br>
            Cooking has always been a part of my life, from the early days spent baking cookies with my grandmother to experimenting with
             exotic spices and ingredients. I believe that food has the incredible power to bring people together, create memorable experiences, 
             and nourish both body and soul.
            
            On this website, you'll find a diverse collection of recipes spanning different cuisines, dietary preferences, and occasions. 
            Whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting your culinary journey, I aim to provide recipes that are approachable, reliable, and,
             most importantly, incredibly tasty. From quick weeknight dinners to impressive showstoppers for special celebrations, 
             there's something here for everyone.
            <br><br>
            I take pride in using fresh, wholesome ingredients and incorporating seasonal produce whenever possible. I strive to make cooking an 
            enjoyable experience by providing clear instructions, helpful tips, and even suggestions for ingredient substitutions to accommodate 
            dietary restrictions or personal preferences.
            <br><br>
            But this website isn't just about recipesâ€”it's about building a group of food lovers who can come together to share their own experiences,
             tips, and stories. I encourage you to leave comments, ask questions, and connect with me and other visitors through my social media ,email or
             my contact number. Let's inspire each other and create a virtual kitchen filled with culinary delights!
            <br><br>
            Thank you for joining me on this flavorful journey. Get ready to embark on a culinary adventure and discover the joy of creating delicious 
            meals that will delight your taste buds and impress your loved ones. Happy cooking!</p>
